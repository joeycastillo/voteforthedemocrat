**Vote For The Democrat** is a small side project from me, [Joey Castillo](https://www.joeycastillo.com/). I made the [stickers](/stickers/) in advance of the 2018 midterms, and in January 2019 revamped the site as a portal for general positivity about all the Democrats running in 2020. We won that election, and still the last guy tried to overturn it. In 2024, that guy is trying to get into power again, and if he does, &mdash; I don't want to sound melodramatic, so I'll put it as mildly as I can &mdash; it will be the end of all things.

There's a simple way to stop it: you vote for Kamala Harris. You vote for the Democrat. It really is that simple; sometimes people need a sticker to remind them.

## About the Stickers

First off, [you can buy them here](https://shop.oddlyspecificobjects.com/products/vote-for-the-democrat-sticker).

Beyond that: they’re stickers, measuring 5½" × 2⅛", printed on high quality white vinyl by the fine folks at [Sticker Guy](https://www.stickerguy.com). They're ideally sized for you to stick on your truck or your water bottle, to leave in a coffee shop, or to put on that one wall in that one restroom that's covered floor to ceiling in stickers. They're also priced cheaply enough that after you've done all those things, you'll probably have some leftover to give your friends and family.
