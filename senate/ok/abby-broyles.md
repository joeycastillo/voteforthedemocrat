Journalist and attorney Abby Broyles has dedicated herself to seeking out the best in Oklahoma, holding those who hurt our families accountable, and protecting taxpayer dollars. Knowing her responsibility as a journalist was to report with accuracy, Abby worked to ensure that voices on all sides were heard, earning the trust of Oklahomans.

Abby graduated college in two-and-a-half years and began working as a journalist at age 20. She spent the majority of her TV career at the NBC affiliate in Oklahoma City.

As an award-winning investigative reporter, Abby uncovered political corruption that led to felony charges against Oklahoma Senator Kyle Loveless; unraveled the story of a hush-money sexual harassment scandal at the state Capitol; exposed a loophole that allowed a sexual predator of children to keep his taxpayer-funded retirement; and held lawmakers accountable for wasting taxpayer dollars defending legislation they knew to be unconstitutional.

To further her advocacy for Oklahomans, Abby put herself through law school while working as a journalist. Her determination to ensure both sides are heard led Abby to hone her legal skills by working on both the prosecution and defense side before passing the bar and opening her own law practice. Now, Abby is running for the United States Senate to bring change to Washington. She will bring people together and work with anyone—Republicans, Democrats, and Independents—who is willing to make a better life for Oklahoma families.

Abby is a lifelong Oklahoman and a graduate of Bethany High School. She was raised in a family that values hard work, integrity, and grit. Her dad managed the credit union down the street, and her mom has been a professor at Southern Nazarene University in Bethany for 40 years.

Abby lives and breathes Oklahoma. She knows our families don’t have time for power-play politics. She’s not afraid of hard work and is ready to hold Senator Jim Inhofe accountable to our families and give Oklahomans back their voice in Washington.
