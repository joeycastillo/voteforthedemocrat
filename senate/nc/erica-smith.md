Erica Smith was born in Fort Bragg, Fayetteville and lived around the world and country before her dad retired from the United States Air Force and the family returned home to northeastern NC. Growing up on the family farm with her five siblings taught Smith the importance of hard work and using available resources to promote economic growth and stability. Senator Smith cherishes the many life lessons she learned from her mother who was a substitute teacher, office manager, seamstress, and homemaker (also known as the domestic engineer in the family). Her father, who passed in 2011, instilled in her strong work ethic, tenacity and grace. 

Smith is a Democratic member of the North Carolina State Senate, representing District 3 – Bertie, Chowan, Edgecombe, Hertford, Martin, Northampton, Tyrrell and Washington counties. She was first elected to the NC General Assembly in 2014 making history as the first woman to serve the district in the Senate. Her prior political experience includes Northampton County Board of Education Member (2008-2014), Northampton County Democratic Party Chair and First-Vice Chair (2006-2013). Smith was unopposed in both the Democratic primary and general elections in 2016. Smith holds leadership as the Co-Chair of the Joint Legislative Women’s Caucus, bipartisan caucus of House and Senate members for the 2017-2019 biennium. She also serves as the Second Vice-Chair of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus for the 2017-2019 Session. Sen. Smith was selected by the State Employees’ Association of North Carolina as the Freshman Legislator of the Year in 2016 and the Lillian’s’ List Political Courage Award Recipient in 2017.

Smith is active in many philanthropic activities, including member of the Northampton County Branch of the NAACP, Halifax County Branch of NAUW and the Enfield-Roanoke Rapids Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. She is an ordained member of the clergy and serves as Associate Servant at Cool Spring Missionary Baptist Church in Gaston NC where she was licensed in 2001. Following catechism, she was ordained in 2002 through the Northampton County and Vicinity Missionary Baptist Association, General Baptist State Convention – North Carolina, National Baptist, USA. A diligent servant leader, Smith is the immediate past First-Vice Moderator of the Association and the only woman in the Association’s 135+ year history elected to serve in a Moderator capacity. She has a strong Judeo-Christian heritage that fuels her commitment to community building, social justice and equal access advocacy.
