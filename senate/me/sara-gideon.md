Sara Gideon is a proud mom, wife, sister, daughter and Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.

Throughout her time in public service, Sara has prioritized listening to Mainers and then working with others to get things done. And under Governors of both parties, Sara has shown an ability to deliver results while standing up for Democratic values.

Whether as a member of her local town council, as a State Representative and now Speaker of the House, Sara has focused on trying to use her office to improve the lives of Maine families.

She’s made expanding access to affordable healthcare a priority by helping pass a law that ensures insurance companies will never be able to discriminate against Mainers with pre-existing conditions and cracking down on pharmaceutical companies to increase drug pricing transparency and help control the cost of prescription drugs.

Sara’s championed job training legislation to address Maine’s workforce shortage and increase economic opportunity across the state. She passed a landmark bill to provide property tax refunds to Maine homeowners, and Sara’s bipartisan LIFT legislation has focused on expanding educational opportunities to make sure Maine families have a chance at financial independence.

Sara has always stood up for a woman’s right to choose. As newly appointed Supreme Court justices threaten the future of Roe vs. Wade and state legislatures across the country pass laws banning abortion in almost all circumstances, Sara has led the fight to make sure women in Maine remain in control of their health care decisions.

She’s been a leading voice in the legislature to draw attention to and deliver resources to combat Maine’s opioid epidemic. Sara’s work has been credited with giving law enforcement and families the tools they need to help save lives. And when former Governor LePage vetoed Sara’s opioid legislation and mocked those suffering from the crisis, Sara did not back down. Instead, she brought Democrats and Republicans together to override that veto, and again put Maine first.

Sara is running for U.S. Senate because she believes too many politicians in Washington are focused more on the special interests than the interests of the people they’re supposed to represent.

As she always has, in the Senate, Sara Gideon will put Maine first.
