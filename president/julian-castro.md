Julian Castro was the secretary of housing and urban development (HUD). Castro was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 23, 2014, and he was confirmed by the Senate on July 9, 2014, by a vote of 71-26. 

During a nomination ceremony on May 23, 2016, President Barack Obama explained how Castro’s family prepared him to serve as the secretary of housing and urban development. “Julián’s grandmother came to this country from Mexico,” Obama said. “She worked as a maid, worked as a cook, worked as a babysitter -- whatever she had to do to keep a roof over her family’s head. And that’s because for her, and generations of Americans like her, a home is more than just a house. A home is a source of pride and security. It’s a place to raise a family and put down roots and build up savings for college or a business or retirement, or write a lifetime of memories. And maybe one day the kid grows up in that home and is able to go on to get a great education and become the Mayor of San Antonio, and become a member of the President’s Cabinet. Julián ha vivido el Sueño Americano. And it’s precisely because he’s lived out the American Dream that he’ll work his tail off to make sure more people can travel that same path and earn their own dreams as well.”

Castro previously served as Mayor of San Antonio. Prior to that, he was a member of the San Antonio City Council, representing District 7.
