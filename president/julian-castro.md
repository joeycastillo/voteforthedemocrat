Julián Castro was raised on the West Side of San Antonio, where his mother instilled in him and his brother Joaquin the power of action. During her campaign as the first Chicana to run for San Antonio city council, she taught them that if you want to make a change in your community, you don’t wait — you work. You make your future happen.

So they did. With their mother’s support, Joaquin and Julián went to college and law school. And in just two generations after their grandmother arrived here with nothing, Joaquin became a Member of Congress and Julián had the honor of serving in President Obama’s Cabinet.

As the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Julián worked to expand the promise of opportunity to Americans all over the nation. Together, Julián and his team made housing more accessible, lessened homelessness among our nation’s veterans and even offered internet access to families in public housing. They set out to help families get back on their feet and achieve more than they thought possible.

Julián has spent the last several years traveling around the nation talking to Americans about their hopes, their dreams and their fears about the future. Americans from all walks of life want the same thing: to do right by their families and have the promise of America fulfilled.

Julián believes that’s exactly what we can do: We can promise young people that college doesn’t have to equal a future of crushing debt. We can promise our seniors that they can count on a life of dignity. We can promise our veterans that they’ll be respected and honored when they come home. We can promise people of color that they are safe, and promise immigrants that they are welcome.

Julián Castro is running for President because he believes that if we work together, we can make — and keep — that promise to every American and work towards a future for all of them.
