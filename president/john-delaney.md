John Delaney grew up in a blue-collar family in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey. His dad was a hardworking, 60-year member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, while his mom stayed home to raise his sister and him. John spent summers as a mason and excavation laborer, painter, landscaper, and most often, an electrician’s assistant, working side by side with his dad.

His parents never had the opportunity to attend college. But because of his mother’s influence, and with help from his father’s labor union, John was able to attend and graduate from Columbia University and Georgetown University Law Center. John paid his way through Columbia with the help of scholarships from his dad’s union, IBEW Local 164, as well as the American Legion, VFW, and the Lion’s Club.

After law school, with the help of some great partners, John decided to take a chance and start his own businesses. By the time John turned 40, he had launched and led two companies that created thousands of jobs, were admired in the community, and were publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

John came to Congress after two decades as a successful entrepreneur, innovator, and business and nonprofit leader. His campaign commitments then were the same as they are today: advance progressive values, find solutions and common ground, bring new ideas, and create forward-looking policies that help everyday Americans.

After John took office in 2012, he introduced large-scale bipartisan legislation on infrastructure, tax reform, social security, and impact investing. He's proud to be a champion for our veterans, public education and pre-kindergarten, bringing jobs to underserved rural and urban communities, and combating the opioid epidemic.

On foreign policy, his work centered on a strong national defense, strengthening our alliances, and cutting sources of terrorism funding. John believe that the best policy making focuses squarely on the future, so he founded the Artificial Intelligence Caucus, and was a founding member of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus.

John met his wife, April, when they were law students at Georgetown University. They have been blessed by four fantastic daughters – ages 24, 20, 17, and 10 – who are the joy of their lives. As a family, they enjoy the outdoors, and spend many holidays camping and hiking in Idaho where April grew up.
