Tim is an independent, no-nonsense congressman from Ohio fighting to rebuild our economy by investing in American workers. Tim is a native Ohioan, born and raised in a small town called Niles just outside Youngstown, Ohio.

A lifelong Rust Belt native, Tim understands that the American Dream is falling too far out of reach. That’s why he’s focused on restoring stability to our fractured communities by rebuilding our economy to work for all Americans. He is committed to building an economy that inspires investment, entrepreneurship and growth.

Before being elected to Congress, Tim served in the Ohio State Senate and began his career in politics as a congressional aide in 1995. Tim has a law degree from the University Of New Hampshire School Of Law and a bachelor’s degree from Bowling Green State University in Ohio.

Tim currently resides in Howland, Ohio with his wife Andrea who teaches elementary school and their three children. He is the author of Healing America: How a Simple Practice Can Help Us Recapture the American Spirit and The Real Food Revolution: Healthy Eating, Green Groceries, and the Return of the American Family Farm.
