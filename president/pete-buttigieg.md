Pete Buttigieg is a millennial Mayor, Afghanistan war veteran, and husband. He is in his eighth and final year as Mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

Pete was first elected mayor in 2011 at only 29 years old, and re-elected in 2015 with 80 percent of the vote.

Under his leadership, South Bend has reimagined its role in the global economy with job growth and major investment in advanced industries, with a focus on data and technology.

Pete served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve, and took an unpaid seven months leave during his mayoral term for a deployment to Afghanistan. For his counterterrorism work, he earned the Joint Service Commendation Medal.

In 2017, he ran for Democratic National Committee chair, earning national praise for his clear message and emphasis on rebuilding the Democratic Party from the ground up in every community. He currently serves as the chair of the “Automation and the Impacts on America’s Cities” task force at the United States Conference of Mayors.

The Washington Post has called him “the most interesting Mayor you’ve never heard of” and President Obama named him one of four Democrats who represented the future of the Democratic Party.

A Rhodes Scholar at Oxford and graduate of Harvard, he lives with his husband Chasten in the same South Bend neighborhood where he grew up, with their two rescue dogs, Truman and Buddy.
