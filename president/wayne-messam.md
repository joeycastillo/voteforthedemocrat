Wayne Messam learned the values of hard work and pride of community from a young age. His parents immigrated to South Florida from Jamaica with just a 5th grade education, seeking greater opportunity for their family. His father labored for 16 years in the sugar cane fields of the Florida Glades after coming to the United States, and his mom would cook to feed the migrant workers. Wayne was born in rural Pahokee, Florida.

Thanks to the opportunity this country provided for his family, the support of his parents and mentors, and lots of time and effort in class and on the field, Wayne earned a full football scholarship to Florida State University, where he started at wide receiver and was a member of the 1993 National Championship team.

After his NFL dreams were cut short, his wife Angela and he built one of the fastest-growing, minority-owned construction businesses in the country. Their projects in the educational and non-profit space have garnered national recognition, including from the U.S. Green Building Council for building one of the greenest schools in the Southeast United States.

He then went into public service, first as a city commissioner, then rising to serve as a two-term mayor of Miramar—one of Florida’s most diverse cities. Today, Miramar ranks as one of the fastest-growing city economies in the country. His record in Miramar includes fighting to to bring American jobs back from China, passing a living wage for city workers and leading the fight against the oil industry’s campaign to drill in Big Cypress National Preserve.

Wayne has been married to his college sweetheart, Angela, for more than 20 years. Their three children, Wayne II and twin daughters Kayla and Kyla, attend college in South Florida.
