Mike Bloomberg grew up in a middle-class family outside of Boston. He wasn’t born into wealth or social connections. His drive to succeed, love of work, and passion for service began at a young age. When he was 12 years old he became one of the youngest Eagle Scouts in history. To help pay his way through Johns Hopkins University, he worked in a parking lot and took out government loans.

In 2001, just weeks after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Mike Bloomberg was elected mayor of New York City in his first run for public office.

Mike and his team rallied New Yorkers and led the city through a new era of progress and prosperity – writing one of the great comeback stories in American history.

He turned around a broken school system, drove down crime to record lows, took on the scourge of illegal guns, and reduced incarceration. He spurred economic growth that led to the creation of 400,000 new jobs and introduced new anti-poverty programs that became national models.

He created new parks, invested in arts and cultural organizations, and pioneered ambitious public health initiatives, including a ban on smoking in all indoor workplaces; launched policies that raised air quality to the highest levels in fifty years and increased average life expectancy for New Yorkers by three years.

And when the global economic crisis hit New York City in 2007, the investments Mike and his team had made helped hold the city together. From the end of the national recession through 2013, New York City gained back 327% of the jobs lost, while the country as a whole gained back only 87%.

By the end of his mayoralty, New York City was safer, stronger and healthier than ever.

Since leaving City Hall, Mike has continued to build on the work he began as mayor, and he has shared his results-oriented approach to management with other mayors around the country. Through Bloomberg Philanthropies, Mike has worked to increase the number of low- and middle-income students who attend top colleges. As a demonstration of that commitment – and to encourage others to join him – Mike gave $1.8 billion to his alma mater Johns Hopkins to forever guarantee need-blind admissions for all students.

He has also taken the fight to the NRA and helped pass commonsense gun laws that save lives in states around the country. And he has led the charge against climate change. His partnership with the Sierra Club has shut down more than half the nation’s coal-fired power plants and replaced many of them with clean energy, saving many lives and creating many new jobs.

Every single day he wakes up and thinks about what he can do to create a healthier, safer, more just world – for his two daughters, Emma and Georgina, for his two grandchildren, Zelda and Jasper, and for all Americans.
