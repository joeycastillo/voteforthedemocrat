Marianne Deborah Williamson is an American spiritual teacher, author, lecturer, entrepreneur and activist. She has published twelve books, including four New York Times number one bestsellers. In 1997 Williamson published her book Healing the Soul of America (hardcover originally titled The Healing of America) and began a more robust political engagement. In this book, Williamson laid out plans to “transform the American political consciousness and encourage powerful citizen involvement to heal our society.”

In response to the HIV/AIDS crises in the 1980s, Marianne founded the Los Angeles and Manhattan Centers for Living, which served as a refuge and non-medical support for people with HIV/AIDS. There they could connect with a variety of psychological and emotional resources, as well as community of support. In 1989, Marianne launched Project Angel Food to build off the work of the Centers for Living. Project Angel Food currently cooks and delivers more than 12,000 meals each week, free of charge, to the homes of men, women and children affected by various life-threatening illnesses. 

Williamson has worked on behalf of women’s empowerment issues for decades. In 1993 she published her #1 NYT bestseller, A Woman’s Worth. Publisher’s Weekly said of the book: “Williamson gives sound, empowering advice on relationships, work, love, sex and childrearing.” In 2010, Marianne launched a series of Sister Giant conferences, trainings and events to support individuals – particularly women – who want to increase their efficacy as activists and/or run for office. 

Williamson ran for the seat of California's 33rd congressional district in 2014. Her core message was that “humanitarian values should replace economic values as the ordering principle of our civilization.” She campaigned on a broad array of progressive issues, including: greater access to high-quality education and free college; child poverty; economic justice; climate change & renewable energy; campaign finance reform; universal health care; criminal justice reform; ending perpetual war and increasing investments in peacebuilding; women’s reproductive rights; and LGBTQ equality among others.
