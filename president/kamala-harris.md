Throughout her career, Kamala Harris has been a fearless advocate for the voiceless and vulnerable and a vocal and determined fighter on behalf of all people.

As U.S. Senator, Kamala introduced or co-sponsored legislation to provide sweeping tax cuts for the middle class, address the high cost of rent, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, make higher education tuition-free for the vast majority of Americans, reform the cash bail system, protect the legal rights of refugees and immigrants, and expand access to affordable, quality health care with Medicare for All.

Kamala has been a key voice in the fight to hold the Trump administration accountable, asking the tough questions on behalf of the American people. She serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Select Committee On Intelligence, and the Committee On Budget.

Kamala aggressively defended the rights of consumers, winning major settlements holding big corporations accountable and forging innovative agreements with the technology industry to protect the privacy of Californians and crack down against online crime. She successfully sued predatory for-profit colleges that scammed students and veterans, prosecuted big polluters, and defended the Affordable Care Act from partisan attacks.

Kamala has been at the forefront of major civil rights battles as well. She was proud to lead the team that helped bring down California’s Proposition 8 at the U.S. Supreme Court and to fight for marriage equality nationwide.

Kamala served two terms as District Attorney of San Francisco. Defeating a two-term incumbent, she was first elected in 2003, and was overwhelmingly re-elected to a second term in November 2007.

She began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office, where she specialized in prosecuting child sexual assault cases. In 1998, she joined the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office, where she led the Career Criminal Unit. She also served as the head of the San Francisco City Attorney’s Division on Children and Families.

Born in Oakland, Kamala Harris is a graduate of Howard University. She earned her law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. She is married to Doug Emhoff and a stepmother to Ella and Cole Emhoff, and is the author of *The Truths We Hold: An American Journey* and *Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor’s Plan to Make Us Safer*.
