Since Tulsi Gabbard was young, she had an innate passion to protect the environment and empower other young people to do the same. At the age of 21, she stepped up to serve in the Hawaii State Legislature, followed by two deployments to the Mideast as a soldier in the Hawaii Army National Guard, and then she returned to serve on the Honolulu City Council. Today, she continues to serve as a fourth-term United States Congresswoman and a major in the National Guard. And now, she is offering to serve as President of the United States, calling for an end to America’s disastrous policy of regime-change wars and a renewed commitment to protecting our planet and rebuilding our communities here at home.

As a teen, Tulsi was concerned about pollution she saw on the beaches and oceans of Hawaii, so she co-founded Healthy Hawaii Coalition and developed a fun program she took to elementary schools teaching kids about the importance of protecting our land and precious water resources.  Wanting to do more, she campaigned for and was elected to the Hawaii State House of Representatives when she was 21 years old.

In 2004, as Tulsi was campaigning for re-election to the State House, the 29th Brigade Combat Team was called up and began preparing to deploy to Iraq. Tulsi’s name was not on the mandatory deployment roster, but she knew there was no way she could stay behind in beautiful Hawaii as her brothers and sisters were sent off to war.

She left an easy win to re-election and volunteered to deploy. Between her two tours of duty in the Middle East, Tulsi worked in the U.S. Senate as a legislative aide to Senator Danny Akaka, where she focused on veterans' issues.

At 31 years old, Tulsi ran for Congress. She entered the race as a clear underdog against a well-established candidate, ran a positive campaign focused on servant leadership in the spirit of aloha, and won a resounding victory.

Serving over 6 years in Congress, and as a member of the Armed Services, Homeland Security, and Foreign Affairs Committees, Tulsi has been a leading voice fighting to end regime change wars and instead focus our military efforts on defeating the terrorist groups that attacked and declared war on the United States. She has approached every issue through the lens of what will best serve the American people, secure our country, and promote peace.
