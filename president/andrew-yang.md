Andrew Yang is an American entrepreneur, the founder of Venture for America, and a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. He has worked in startups and early stage growth companies as a founder or executive for nearly two decades and was appointed to public office in 2015 by the Obama administration as an Ambassador of Global Entrepreneurship.

Yang is the author of _Smart People Should Build Things_ and _The War on Normal People_, books about automation of labor. In Yang's current bid for the 2020 presidential nomination, one of his main campaign goals would be to implement a universal basic income (UBI) for every American adult over the age of 18. His campaign proposes a $1,000/month "Freedom Dividend" to all U.S. citizens between the ages of 18 to 64, and other responses to predictions of mass unemployment from technological automation. 

Yang is the first man of Asian ancestry to run for President of the United States as a Democrat.
