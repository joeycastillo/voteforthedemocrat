Actually, it wasn't. Mostly, it sucked. There was a time — 2016, specifically — when voting for the Democrat could have avoided all of this. There was a time (2020) when voting for the Democrat at least meant avoiding the worst of it. In 2024, we could have put the whole thing to bed forever. Alas.

Going forward, voting for the Democrat may not be sufficient given what we know is coming. So for now take care of yourselves, protect the people closest to you, and above all: brace for impact.

Also if you know anyone who wants 5,000 “Vote for the Democrat” stickers, let me know.
